Bismillah, Alhamdulillah, Washalatu Wasalam 'Ala Rasulillah.
a official personal site of me, i think is important to have a personal site as developer or even other profesion, generaly documentation, writings is important for everyone, and for developer especialy web developer, public personal site is our living example of our work, we need it to show our portofolio, not only that, sometimes we forgot what things that we learned, or there is things that we want to share to others.

So personal site will be really good tools for us to show portofolio and sharing, and making documentation!

Alhamdulillah, praise to Allah!
After knowing the importance of making personal site, this is my personal site repo.

I was confused and moved around in deciding what technology to make it, bu Alhamdulillah then i decide to build the site with JAMSTACK, simple but powerfull ðŸ”¥.

I hope this site can be beneficial for me and for others, not only developer but everyone, thank you!
