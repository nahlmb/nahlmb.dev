<hr>
<p>A fork of <a href="https://github.com/wankdanker/node-tableify">tableify</a>.
All the cli rekated code and dependencies is removed.
Add public methods for generating a complete html document with styling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var tableify = require('tableify')
// just the table
tableify({ foo: 'bar' })

// html document with style
tableify.htmlDoc({ foo: 'bar' })
tableify.fancyHtmlDoc({ foo: 'bar' })
</code></pre>
<p>From any JavaScript object, HTML tables create.</p>
<h2>description</h2>
<p>Given any Javascript object including Object, Array, Number, Date, null, undefined, primitives,
etc, <code>tableify</code> generates HTML tables that represent each object. In the case of Arrays containing
Objects (hash tables), it will generate a table with a header row containing the key names of the
object found in the first element of the array.</p>
<p>Every value to be output to the table is processed through <code>tableify</code> recursively so objects containing
other objects will result in tables within tables.</p>
<p>For each <code>td</code> cell that is created, a class is generated based on the <code>constructor.name</code> of the value, or
<code>null</code> if the value is null.</p>
<h2>install</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install @kessler/tableify
</code></pre>
<h2>usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var tableify = require('tableify');

// embed the table in an html document with some styling
var html = tableify.htmlDoc({
	someArrayOfObjects : [
		{ a : 1, b : 2, c : 3  }
		, { a : 2, b : 3, c : 4 }
		, { a : 3, b : 4, c : 5 }
	]
	, someObject : {
		key1 : 'value1'
		, someArray : [
			'value2'
			, 'value3'
			, 'value4'
			, 'value5'
		]
		, someArrayOfObjects : [
			{ key2 : 123 }
			, { key2 : 234 }
			, { key2 : 345 }
		]
	}
});

console.log(html);

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>

pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<ul>
<li>name: assert-plus</li>
<li>version: 1.0.0</li>
<li>description: Extra assertions on top of node's assert module</li>
<li>licenses: MIT</li>
<li>copyright:</li>
<li>licenseText: # assert-plus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
<code>assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')</code>.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
</code></pre>
<h1>API</h1>
<p>All methods that <em>aren't</em> part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; <code>AssertionError</code>
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:</p>
<pre><code>AssertionError: foo (string) is required
at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)
</code></pre>
<p>from:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
</code></pre>
<p>There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with <code>Arrayof$Type</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You can assert IFF an argument is not <code>undefined</code> (i.e., an optional arg):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable <code>NODE_NDEBUG=1</code>.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay <code>typeof ()</code> taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from <code>assert</code> are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the <code>assert</code> module avoids this behavior.</p>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<li>description: two functions: One that returns true, one that returns false</li>
<li>licenses: ISC</li>
<li>copyright:</li>
<li>licenseText: #boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (<code>trueFunc</code>) and one that always returns false (<code>falseFunc</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>###WTF?</p>
<p>By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. <a href="https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect"><code>CSSselect</code></a> uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.</p>
<p>###And why is this a separate module?</p>
<p>I'm trying to modularize <code>CSSselect</code> and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

<p>... each one is a full, working example - just have a look at the <code>readme.md</code> in each one for installation
instructions.</p>
<h3>Contributions / Feedback</h3>
<p>Spotted an error? Couldn't get one of the examples running? Have your own sweet setup that you want to show off to the world?
We'd love to receive your feedback and contributions - so please get in touch! We aim to make this project the canonical source
of example projects &amp; code snippets related to running Browsersync.</p>
<h3>How to contribute an example</h3>
<p>First thing you should do, is take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server">simplest example here</a> -
this will give you a great head-start on setting up your code.</p>
<p>Then, <code>fork</code> this repo and <code>clone</code> your fork down to your local machine. Now create a new folder inside <code>recipes</code>
(note the naming structure). This is where you create your awesome example. You're free to do as you like,
but there are a couple of rules you'll need to follow to ensure the project can build.</p>
<p><strong>Required Files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>package.json</code> (see below for requirements)</li>
<li><code>app.js</code> (or any JS file showing the example)</li>
<li><code>./app</code> directory. Always include the minimum HTML, JS &amp; CSS needed to prove your example.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do NOT include</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>readme.md</code> (this is created dynamically for you)</li>
<li>any other files that are not related to your example.</li>
</ul>
<h3>package.json requirements</h3>
<p><strong>start command</strong>: For consistency, ensure your example can be run with the command <code>npm start</code>. To
do this, you just need to provide something along these lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node app.js&quot;
},
</code></pre>
<p><strong>main file</strong>: We inline your main Javascript file into the <code>readme.md</code>, so
don't miss this field.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;main&quot;: &quot;app.js&quot; // or gulpfile.js etc
</code></pre>
<p><strong>description</strong>: We use this as the Title. So make it short and descriptive, such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Server example&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Finally, build.</h3>
<p>After you've added your example in the recipes folder, return to the root and run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>This will install <a href="https://github.com/shakyShane/crossbow.js">Crossbow.js</a> and compile the project.
Commit everything that has changed and push it up to your fork. Send a Pull Request when you're
ready, or if you'd like us to have a look over your code before that, just ping us <a href="https://twitter.com/browsersync">twitter</a> and we'll
take a look!

<p>Creative Commons Corporation (&quot;Creative Commons&quot;) is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis. Creative Commons gives no

terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons

<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<pre><code> Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
 material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
 material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
 licensed material, or material used under an exception or
 limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

<p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License</p>
<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Section 1 -- Definitions.</p>
<p>a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
synched in timed relation with a moving image.</p>
<p>b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
Rights.</p>
<p>d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
agreements.</p>
<p>e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</p>
<p>f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
License.</p>
<p>g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.</p>
<p>h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.</p>
<p>i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
available to the public including in ways that members of the
public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.</p>
<p>j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
equivalent rights anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.</p>
<p>Section 2 -- Scope.</p>
<p>a. License grant.</p>
<pre><code>   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
           in part; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
      (4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
           Public License.

        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
</code></pre>
<p>b. Other rights.</p>
<pre><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
      Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
      Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
      reserves any right to collect such royalties.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.</p>
<p>a. Attribution.</p>
<pre><code>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
      form), You must:

        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
           with the Licensed Material:

             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                warranties;

             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                extent reasonably practicable;

        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
           hyperlink to, this Public License.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
      information.

   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
      reasonably practicable.

   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
      Material from complying with this Public License.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
portion of the contents of the database;</p>
<p>b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</p>
<p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.</p>
<p>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</p>
<p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
terminate automatically.</p>
<p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<pre><code>   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
      violation; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.
</code></pre>
<p>c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
will not terminate this Public License.</p>
<p>d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.</p>
<p>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
<p>b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>Section 8 -- Interpretation.</p>
<p>a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
be made without permission under this Public License.</p>
<p>b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
conditions.</p>
<p>c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.</p>
<p>d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>

<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not

<pre><code> Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by

 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before

 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for

 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.

           in part; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
      (4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
           Public License.

        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
</code></pre>
<p>b. Other rights.</p>
<pre><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
      Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
      Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
      reserves any right to collect such royalties.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.</p>
<p>a. Attribution.</p>
<pre><code>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
      form), You must:

        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
           with the Licensed Material:

             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                warranties;

             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                extent reasonably practicable;

        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
           hyperlink to, this Public License.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
      information.

   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
      reasonably practicable.

   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
      Material from complying with this Public License.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
portion of the contents of the database;</p>
<p>b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</p>
<p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.</p>
<p>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</p>
<p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
terminate automatically.</p>
<p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<pre><code>   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
      violation; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.
</code></pre>
<p>c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
will not terminate this Public License.</p>
<p>d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.</p>
<p>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
<p>b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>Section 8 -- Interpretation.</p>
<p>a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
be made without permission under this Public License.</p>
<p>b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
conditions.</p>
<p>c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.</p>
<p>d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>

<p>Terminal string styling done right</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk"><img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Marak/colors.js">colors.js</a> is currently the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending String.prototype which causes all kinds of <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68">problems</a>. Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.</p>
<p><strong>Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.</strong></p>
<p><img src="screenshot.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doesn't extend String.prototype</strong></li>
<li>Expressive API</li>
<li>Clean and focused</li>
<li>Auto-detects color support</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li><a href="https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk">Used by 150+ modules</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Install with <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/chalk">npm</a>: <code>npm install --save chalk</code></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var chalk = require('chalk');

// style a string
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );

// combine styled and normal strings
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );

// compose multiple styles using the chainable API
console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );

// nest styles
console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );

// pass in multiple arguments
console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  );
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily define your own themes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var chalk = require('chalk');
var error = chalk.bold.red;
console.log(error('Error!'));
</code></pre>
<h2>API</h2>
<h3>chalk.<code>&lt;style&gt;[.&lt;style&gt;...](string, [string...])</code></h3>
<p>Example: <code>chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');</code></p>
<p>Chain <a href="#styles">styles</a> and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Multiple arguments will be separated by space.</p>
<h3>chalk.enabled</h3>
<p>Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it.</p>
<h3>chalk.supportsColor</h3>
<p>Detect whether the terminal <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-color">supports color</a>.</p>
<p>Can be overridden by the user with the flags <code>--color</code> and <code>--no-color</code>.</p>
<p>Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.</p>
<h3>chalk.styles</h3>
<p>Exposes the styles as <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles">ANSI escape codes</a>.</p>
<p>Generally not useful, but you might need just the <code>.open</code> or <code>.close</code> escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.styles.red);
//=&gt; {open: '\x1b[31m', close: '\x1b[39m'}

console.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close);
</code></pre>
<h3>chalk.stripColor(string)</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi">Strip color</a> from a string.</p>
<p>Can be useful in combination with <code>.supportsColor</code> to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var chalk = require('chalk');
var styledString = fromExternal();

if (!chalk.supportsColor) {
	chalk.stripColor(styledString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar"><img src="https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png" alt="NPM"></a></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Node.js <code>fs.watch</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.</li>
<li>Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.</li>
<li>Often reports events twice.</li>
<li>Emits most changes as <code>rename</code>.</li>
<li>Has <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&amp;type=Issues">a lot of other issues</a></li>
<li>Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Node.js <code>fs.watchFile</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost as bad at event handling.</li>
<li>Also does not provide any recursive watching.</li>
<li>Results in high CPU utilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chokidar resolves these problems.</p>
<p>Initially made for <strong><a href="http://brunch.io">Brunch</a></strong> (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
<a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/">gulp</a>,
<a href="http://karma-runner.github.io">karma</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Unitech/PM2">PM2</a>,
<a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a>,
<a href="http://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>,
<a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Microsoft's Visual Studio Code</a>,
and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/">many others</a>.
It has proven itself in production environments.</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core <code>fs</code> module, but when using
<code>fs.watch</code> and <code>fs.watchFile</code> for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.</p>
<p>On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
<code>FSEvents</code> API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like <code>kqueue</code> available on most *nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.</p>
<p>On other platforms, the <code>fs.watch</code>-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Install with npm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install chokidar
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>require</code> and use it in your code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) =&gt; {
  console.log(event, path);
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path =&gt; log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path =&gt; log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error =&gt; log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () =&gt; log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) =&gt; {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) =&gt; {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

</code></pre>
<h2>API</h2>
<p><code>chokidar.watch(paths, [options])</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>paths</code> (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.</li>
<li><code>options</code> (object) Options object as defined below:</li>
</ul>
<h4>Persistence</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>persistent</code> (default: <code>true</code>). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
<code>false</code> when using <code>fsevents</code> to watch, no more events will be emitted
after <code>ready</code>, even if the process continues to run.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Path filtering</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>ignored</code> (<a href="https://github.com/es128/anymatch">anymatch</a>-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
<a href="http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats"><code>fs.Stats</code></a>
object of that path).</li>
<li><code>ignoreInitial</code> (default: <code>false</code>). If set to <code>false</code> then <code>add</code>/<code>addDir</code> events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the <code>ready</code> event).</li>
<li><code>followSymlinks</code> (default: <code>true</code>). When <code>false</code>, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.</li>
<li><code>cwd</code> (no default). The base directory from which watch <code>paths</code> are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.</li>
<li><code>disableGlobbing</code> (default: <code>false</code>). If set to <code>true</code> then the strings passed to <code>.watch()</code> and <code>.add()</code> are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>usePolling</code> (default: <code>false</code>).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to <code>false</code>. It is
typically necessary to <strong>set this to <code>true</code> to successfully watch files over
a network</strong>, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to <code>true</code> explicitly on MacOS overrides the
<code>useFsEvents</code> default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.</li>
<li><em>Polling-specific settings</em> (effective when <code>usePolling: true</code>)
<ul>
<li><code>interval</code> (default: <code>100</code>). Interval of file system polling. You may also
set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.</li>
<li><code>binaryInterval</code> (default: <code>300</code>). Interval of file system
polling for binary files.
(<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json">see list of binary extensions</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>useFsEvents</code> (default: <code>true</code> on MacOS). Whether to use the
<code>fsevents</code> watching interface if available. When set to <code>true</code> explicitly
and <code>fsevents</code> is available this supercedes the <code>usePolling</code> setting. When
set to <code>false</code> on MacOS, <code>usePolling: true</code> becomes the default.</li>
<li><code>alwaysStat</code> (default: <code>false</code>). If relying upon the
<a href="http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats"><code>fs.Stats</code></a>
object that may get passed with <code>add</code>, <code>addDir</code>, and <code>change</code> events, set
this to <code>true</code> to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.</li>
<li><code>depth</code> (default: <code>undefined</code>). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.</li>
<li><code>awaitWriteFinish</code> (default: <code>false</code>).
By default, the <code>add</code> event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some <code>change</code>
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting <code>awaitWriteFinish</code> to <code>true</code> (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its <code>add</code> and <code>change</code> events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
<ul>
<li><em><code>options.awaitWriteFinish</code> can be set to an object in order to adjust
timing params:</em></li>
<li><code>awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold</code> (default: 2000). Amount of time in
milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.</li>
<li><code>awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval</code> (default: 100). File size polling interval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>ignorePermissionErrors</code> (default: <code>false</code>). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to <code>EPERM</code>
or <code>EACCES</code> with this set to <code>true</code>, the errors will be suppressed silently.</li>
<li><code>atomic</code> (default: <code>true</code> if <code>useFsEvents</code> and <code>usePolling</code> are <code>false</code>).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
&quot;atomic writes&quot; instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a <code>change</code> event
rather than <code>unlink</code> then <code>add</code>. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting <code>atomic</code> to a custom value, in
milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Methods &amp; Events</h3>
<p><code>chokidar.watch()</code> produces an instance of <code>FSWatcher</code>. Methods of <code>FSWatcher</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.add(path / paths)</code>: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.</li>
<li><code>.on(event, callback)</code>: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: <code>add</code>, <code>addDir</code>, <code>change</code>, <code>unlink</code>, <code>unlinkDir</code>, <code>ready</code>,
<code>raw</code>, <code>error</code>.
Additionally <code>all</code> is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than <code>ready</code>, <code>raw</code>, and <code>error</code>.</li>
<li><code>.unwatch(path / paths)</code>: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.</li>
<li><code>.close()</code>: Removes all listeners from watched files.</li>
<li><code>.getWatched()</code>: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this <code>FSWatcher</code> instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the <code>cwd</code> option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CLI</h2>
<p>If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
<a href="https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli">chokidar-cli</a>, allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.</p>
<h2>Install Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This message is normal part of how <code>npm</code> handles optional dependencies and is
not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
Chokidar should function properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ERR! stack Error: Python executable &quot;python&quot; is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
<code>npm config set python python2.7</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make</code></p>
<ul>
<li>On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>description: Safely get a dot-notated property within an object.</li>
<li>licenses: MIT</li>
<li>copyright:</li>
<li>licenseText: # <code>dlv(obj, keypath)</code> <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/dlv"><img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg" alt="NPM"></a> <a href="https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master" alt="Build"></a></li>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Smallest possible implementation: only <strong>130 bytes.</strong></p>
<p>You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write <a href="https://github.com/developit/dlv/blob/master/test.js">tests</a>.</p>
<p>Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p><code>npm install --save dlv</code></p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p><code>delve(object, keypath, [default])</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

//undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Make your errors more descriptive:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Use as a command line tool:</strong></p>
<pre><code>~ $ errno 53
{
  &quot;errno&quot;: 53,
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;ENOTEMPTY&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;directory not empty&quot;
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  &quot;errno&quot;: 56,
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;EROFS&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;read-only file system&quot;
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.</p>
<p>You will need to install with <code>npm install errno -g</code> if you want the <code>errno</code> command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.</p>
<p><a name="customerrors"></a></p>
<h2>Custom errors</h2>
<p>Use <code>errno.custom.createError()</code> to create custom <code>Error</code> objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so <code>instanceof</code> becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a <code>cause</code> property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
</code></pre>
<p>Also available is a <code>errno.custom.FilesystemError</code> with in-built access to errno properties:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: <code>code</code>, <code>errno</code>, <code>path</code> and <code>message</code> will contain a descriptive human-readable message.</p>

<p>Esrecurse (<a href="https://github.com/estools/esrecurse">esrecurse</a>) is
<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</a>
recursive traversing functionality.</p>
<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<p>The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>We can use <code>Visitor</code> instance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
</code></pre>
<p>We can inherit <code>Visitor</code> instance easily.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
</code></pre>
<p>And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>childVisitorKeys</code> option does customize the behaviour of <code>this.visitChildren(node)</code>.
We can use user-defined node types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
</code></pre>
<p>We can use the <code>fallback</code> option as well.
If the <code>fallback</code> option is <code>&quot;iteration&quot;</code>, <code>esrecurse</code> would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. <code>node.parent</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>fallback</code> option is a function, <code>esrecurse</code> calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. <code>node.parent</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
</code></pre>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<p>Turn a *-wildcard style glob (<code>&quot;*.min.js&quot;</code>) into a regular expression
(<code>/^.*\.min\.js$/</code>)!</p>
<p>To match bash-like globs, eg. <code>?</code> for any single-character match, <code>[a-z]</code> for
character ranges, and <code>{*.html, *.js}</code> for multiple alternatives, call with
<code>{ extended: true }</code>.</p>
<p>To obey <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer">globstars <code>**</code></a> rules set option <code>{globstar: true}</code>.
NOTE: This changes the behavior of <code>*</code> when <code>globstar</code> is <code>true</code> as shown below:
When <code>{globstar: true}</code>: <code>/foo/**</code> will match any string that starts with <code>/foo/</code>
like <code>/foo/index.htm</code>, <code>/foo/bar/baz.txt</code>, etc.  Also, <code>/foo/**/*.txt</code> will match
any string that starts with <code>/foo/</code> and ends with <code>.txt</code> like <code>/foo/bar.txt</code>,
<code>/foo/bar/baz.txt</code>, etc.
Whereas <code>/foo/*</code> (single <code>*</code>, not a globstar) will match strings that start with
<code>/foo/</code> like <code>/foo/index.htm</code>, <code>/foo/baz.txt</code> but will not match strings that
contain a <code>/</code> to the right like <code>/foo/bar/baz.txt</code>, <code>/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Set flags on the resulting <code>RegExp</code> object by adding the <code>flags</code> property to the option object, eg <code>{ flags: &quot;i&quot; }</code> for ignoring case.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<pre><code>npm install glob-to-regexp
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp');
var re = globToRegExp(&quot;p*uck&quot;);
re.test(&quot;pot luck&quot;); // true
re.test(&quot;pluck&quot;); // true
re.test(&quot;puck&quot;); // true

re = globToRegExp(&quot;*.min.js&quot;);
re.test(&quot;http://example.com/jquery.min.js&quot;); // true
re.test(&quot;http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map&quot;); // false

re = globToRegExp(&quot;*/www/*.js&quot;);
re.test(&quot;http://example.com/www/app.js&quot;); // true
re.test(&quot;http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js&quot;); // true

// Extended globs
re = globToRegExp(&quot;*/www/{*.js,*.html}&quot;, { extended: true });
re.test(&quot;http://example.com/www/app.js&quot;); // true
re.test(&quot;http://example.com/www/index.html&quot;); // true

<ul>
<li>name: hamljs</li>
<li>version: 0.6.2</li>
<li>description: Faster / Express compliant Haml implementation</li>
<li>licenses: MIT*</li>
<li>copyright: Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;</li>
<li>licenseText: # Haml.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>High performance JavaScript <a href="http://haml-lang.com">Haml</a> implementation for <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs</a></p>
<p>For a higher quality implementation you may want to look at my <a href="http://jade-lang.com">Jade</a> template engine,
however the syntax is slightly different. Jade's engine may be back-ported to haml.js in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/haml.js"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/haml.js.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre><code>  $ npm install hamljs

  node&gt; require('hamljs')
</code></pre>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p>To use with <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express</a> and the .haml extension, simply register the engine:</p>
<pre><code> app.engine('.haml', require('hamljs').renderFile);
</code></pre>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Benchmarks rendering the same 21 line haml file located at <em>benchmarks/page.haml</em>,
shows that this library is nearly <strong>65%</strong> or <strong>3 times</strong> faster than haml-js.</p>
<pre><code>  Winner: haml.js
  Compared with next highest (haml-js), it's:
  65.39% faster
  2.89 times as fast
  0 order(s) of magnitude faster
</code></pre>
<p>Haml.js attempts to comply with the original <a href="http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html">Haml</a>
implementation as well as possible. There are no magic &quot;plugins&quot; like
found in other JavaScript haml implementations, for example the following
will work just fine:</p>
<pre><code>- if (items)
  %ul
    - for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; ++i)
      %li= items[i]
</code></pre>
<p>Iteration is the one exception to these magical plugins,
since this is <strong>ugly</strong> in JavaScript, you may also:</p>
<pre><code>- if (items)
  %ul
    - each item in items
      %li= item
</code></pre>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<pre><code>%div text
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<pre><code>%div.article.first
  article text here
  and here
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;article first&quot;&gt;
  article text here and here
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Div Class Shortcut</h2>
<pre><code>.comment hey
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;hey&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Div Id Shortcut</h2>
<pre><code>#article-1 foo
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;article-1&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Combining Ids and Classes</h2>
<p>You may chain id and classes in any order:</p>
<pre><code>.article#first.summary content
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;first&quot; class=&quot;article summary&quot;&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<pre><code>%a{ href: 'http://google.com', title: 'Google It' } Google
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google It&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Attribute keys such as &quot;for&quot; are automatically quoted
by haml.js, so instead of:</p>
<pre><code>%label{ 'for': 'something' }
</code></pre>
<p>you should:</p>
<pre><code>%label{ for: 'something' }
</code></pre>
<p>which will render:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;something&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Boolean Attributes</h2>
<pre><code>%input{ type: 'checkbox', checked: true }
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Combining Attributes, Ids, and Classes</h2>
<p>Wemay also contain id and classes before or after:</p>
<pre><code>%a.button{ href: 'http://google.com', title: 'Google It' }.first Google
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google It&quot; class=&quot;button first&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>Code starting with a hyphen will be executed but
not buffered, where as code using the equals sign
will be buffered:</p>
<pre><code>- a = 1
- b = 2
= a + b
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<p>HTML buffered with equals sign will <strong>always</strong> be escaped:</p>
<pre><code>= &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To prevent escaping of HTML entities we can use <em>!=</em>:</p>
<pre><code>!= &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Iteration</h2>
<pre><code>%ul
  - each item in items
    %li= item
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;three&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you require the key or index of the object
or array during iteration simple append a comma
following another id:</p>
<pre><code>%ul
  - each item, index in items
    %li= item + '(' + index + ')'
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one(0)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two(1)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;three(2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Doctypes</h2>
<p>Defaults to transitional:</p>
<pre><code>!!!
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Optionally pass a supported doctype name:</p>
<pre><code>!!! strict
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>currently supported doctypes, which can be
extended simply by adding values to to <em>haml.doctypes</em>.</p>
<pre><code>'5': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;',
'xml': '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;',
'default': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;',
'strict': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;',
'frameset': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd&quot;&gt;',
'1.1': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;',
'basic': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic11.dtd&quot;&gt;',
'mobile': '&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.2//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/xhtml-mobile12.dtd&quot;&gt;'
</code></pre>
<h2>String interpolation</h2>
<pre><code>%div Hello #{world}
</code></pre>
<p>with locals:</p>
<pre><code>{ world: &quot;World!&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>:cdata</h2>
<pre><code>%script
  :cdata
    foo
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
foo
]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>:javascript</h2>
<pre><code>%head
  :javascript
    if (foo)
      if (bar)
        alert('baz')
</code></pre>
<p>html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
  //&lt;![CDATA[
  if (foo)
    if (bar)
      alert('baz')
  //]]&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Extending Haml</h2>
<h3>Adding Filters</h3>
<pre><code>var haml = require('hamljs')
haml.filters.my_filter = function(str) {
  return doSomethingWith(str)
}
</code></pre>
<p>by registering the filter function <em>my_filter</em> we can now
utilize it within our Haml templates as shown below:
%p
:my_filter
some text
here yay
whoop awesome</p>
<h3>Adding Doctypes</h3>
<pre><code>var haml = require('hamljs')
haml.doctypes.foo = '&lt;!DOCTYPE ... &gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>Will now allow you to:
!!! foo</p>

<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

</ul>
<p>A zero-dependency alternative to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig">cosmiconfig</a> with the same API.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install lilconfig
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {lilconfig, lilconfigSync} from 'lilconfig';

// all keys are optional
const options = {
    stopDir: '/Users/you/some/dir',
    searchPlaces: ['package.json', 'myapp.conf.js'],
    ignoreEmptySearchPlaces: false
}

lilconfig(
    'myapp',
    options // optional
).search() // Promise&lt;LilconfigResult&gt;

lilconfigSync(
    'myapp',
    options // optional
).load(pathToConfig) // LilconfigResult

/**
 * LilconfigResult
 * {
 *   config: any; // your config
 *   filepath: string;
 * }
 */
</code></pre>
<h2>Difference to <code>cosmiconfig</code></h2>
<p>Lilconfig does not intend to be 100% compatible with <code>cosmiconfig</code> but tries to mimic it where possible. The key differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>no</strong> support for yaml files out of the box(<code>lilconfig</code> attempts to parse files with no extension as JSON instead of YAML). You can still add the support for YAML files by providing a loader, see an <a href="#loaders-example">example</a> below.</li>
<li><strong>no</strong> cache</li>
</ul>
<h3>Options difference between the two.</h3>

<h2>Loaders example</h2>
<p>If you need the YAML support you can provide your own loader</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {lilconig} from 'lilconfig';
import yaml from 'yaml';

const options = {
    loaders: {
        '.yaml': (filepath, content) =&gt; {
            return yaml.parse(content);
        },
        // loader for files with no extension
        noExt: (filepath, content) =&gt; {
            return yaml.parse(content);
        }
    }
};

lilconfig('myapp', options)
    .search()
    .then(result =&gt; {
        result // {config, filepath}
    });
</code></pre>

<p>lit-html is the template system that powers the <a href="https://lit.dev">Lit</a> library for building fast web components.</p>
<h2>About this release</h2>
<p>This release candidate of lit-html 2.0 is intended to be feature complete and API stable. Please note the minor breaking changes from lit-html 1.0 in the <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/releases/upgrade/">lit.dev upgrade guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Full documentation is available at <a href="https://lit.dev">lit.dev</a>.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><code>lit-html</code> lets you write <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template">HTML templates</a> in JavaScript with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">template literals</a>.</p>
<p>lit-html templates are plain JavaScript and combine the familiarity of writing HTML with the power of JavaScript. lit-html takes care of efficiently rendering templates to DOM, including efficiently updating the DOM with new values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import {html, render} from 'lit-html';

// This is a lit-html template function. It returns a lit-html template.
const helloTemplate = (name) =&gt; html`&lt;div&gt;Hello ${name}!&lt;/div&gt;`;

// This renders &lt;div&gt;Hello Steve!&lt;/div&gt; to the document body
render(helloTemplate('Steve'), document.body);

// This updates to &lt;div&gt;Hello Kevin!&lt;/div&gt;, but only updates the ${name} part
render(helloTemplate('Kevin'), document.body);
</code></pre>
<p><code>lit-html</code> provides two main exports:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>html</code>: A JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals">template tag</a> used to produce a <code>TemplateResult</code>, which is a container for a template, and the values that should populate the template.</li>
<li><code>render()</code>: A function that renders a <code>TemplateResult</code> to a DOM container, such as an element or shadow root.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install lit-html
</code></pre>
<p>Or use from <code>lit</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install lit
</code></pre>

<h1>Mitt</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Tiny 200b functional event emitter / pubsub.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microscopic:</strong> weighs less than 200 bytes gzipped</li>
<li><strong>Useful:</strong> a wildcard <code>&quot;*&quot;</code> event type listens to all events</li>
<li><strong>Familiar:</strong> same names &amp; ideas as <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter">Node's EventEmitter</a></li>
<li><strong>Functional:</strong> methods don't rely on <code>this</code></li>
<li><strong>Great Name:</strong> somehow <a href="https://npm.im/mitt">mitt</a> wasn't taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitt was made for the browser, but works in any JavaScript runtime. It has no dependencies and supports IE9+.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">import mitt from 'mitt'

const emitter = mitt()

// listen to an event
emitter.on('foo', e =&gt; console.log('foo', e) )

// listen to all events
emitter.on('*', (type, e) =&gt; console.log(type, e) )

// fire an event
emitter.emit('foo', { a: 'b' })

// working with handler references:
function onFoo() {}
emitter.on('foo', onFoo)   // listen
emitter.off('foo', onFoo)  // unlisten
</code></pre>

<p>Bismillah, Alhamdulillah, Washalatu Wasalam 'Ala Rasulillah.
a official personal site of me, i think is important to have a personal site as developer or even other profesion, generaly documentation, writings is important for everyone, and for developer especialy web developer, public personal site is our living example of our work, we need it to show our portofolio, not only that, sometimes we forgot what things that we learned, or there is things that we want to share to others.</p>
<p>So personal site will be really good tools for us to show portofolio and sharing, and making documentation!</p>
<p>Alhamdulillah, praise to Allah!
After knowing the importance of making personal site, this is my personal site repo.</p>
<p>I was confused and moved around in deciding what technology to make it, bu Alhamdulillah then i decide to build the site with JAMSTACK, simple but powerfull 🔥.</p>
<p>I hope this site can be beneficial for me and for others, not only developer but everyone, thank you!</p>
<p><em>Alhamdulillahiladzi bini'mathi tathimusholihat</em></p>

<p>The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.</p>
<p>If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.</p>
<p>You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.</p>
<p>If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.</p>

<pre><code>    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       Version 2, June 1991
</code></pre>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<pre><code>      Preamble
</code></pre>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<pre><code>    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
</code></pre>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</code></pre>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</code></pre>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<pre><code>NO WARRANTY
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<li>mailto URLs: open the default email client</li>
<li>file URLs: open a window showing the directory (on OS X)</li>
</ul>
<p>Example interaction on the Node.js REPL:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; require(&quot;openurl&quot;).open(&quot;http://rauschma.de&quot;)
&gt; require(&quot;openurl&quot;).open(&quot;mailto:john@example.com&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>You can generate emails as follows:</p>
<pre><code>require(&quot;openurl&quot;).mailto([&quot;john@example.com&quot;, &quot;jane@example.com&quot;],
    { subject: &quot;Hello!&quot;, body: &quot;This is\nan automatically sent email!\n&quot; });
</code></pre>
<p>Install via npm:</p>
<pre><code>npm install openurl
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not yet terribly familiar with implementing npm packages, so any feedback is welcome
(especially experience reports on Windows and Linux, which I can’t test on).</p>

<p>Simple, flexible file copy utility</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recursively copy whole directory hierarchies</li>
<li>Choose which files are copied by passing a filter function, regular expression or glob</li>
<li>Rename files dynamically, including changing the output path</li>
<li>Transform file contents using streams</li>
<li>Choose whether to overwrite existing files</li>
<li>Choose whether to copy system files</li>
<li>Filters out <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/junk">junk</a> files by default</li>

<li>Emits start, finish and error events for each file that is processed</li>
<li>Optional promise-based interface</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h4>Node-style callback interface</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var copy = require('recursive-copy');

copy('src', 'dest', function(error, results) {
	if (error) {
		console.error('Copy failed: ' + error);
	} else {
		console.info('Copied ' + results.length + ' files');
	}
});
</code></pre>
<h4>Promise interface</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var copy = require('recursive-copy');

copy('src', 'dest')
	.then(function(results) {
		console.info('Copied ' + results.length + ' files');
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		console.error('Copy failed: ' + error);
	});
</code></pre>
<h4>TypeScript usage</h4>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import copy from 'recursive-copy';

try {
	await copy('src', 'dest');
} catch (e) {
}

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p>Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: <code>foo\\bar</code> ➔ <code>foo/bar</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877">Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows</a> as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.</p>
<p>This was created since the <code>path</code> methods in Node outputs <code>\\</code> paths on Windows.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm install --save slash
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">var path = require('path');
var slash = require('slash');

var str = path.join('foo', 'bar');
// Unix    =&gt; foo/bar
// Windows =&gt; foo\\bar

slash(str);
// Unix    =&gt; foo/bar
// Windows =&gt; foo/bar
</code></pre>
<h2>API</h2>
<h3>slash(path)</h3>
<p>Type: <code>string</code></p>
<p>Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a slash path.</p>

<li>licenseText: # Source Map</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a library to generate and consume the source map format
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit">described here</a>.</p>
<p>This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works
in the following environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an
AMD loader such as RequireJS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Node</h2>
<pre><code>$ npm install source-map
</code></pre>
<h2>Building from Source (for everywhere else)</h2>
<p>Install Node and then run</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git
$ cd source-map
$ npm link .
</code></pre>
<p>Next, run</p>
<pre><code>$ node Makefile.dryice.js
</code></pre>
<p>This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>dist/source-map.js</code> - The unminified browser version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dist/source-map.min.js</code> - The minified browser version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dist/SourceMap.jsm</code> - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Consuming a source map</h3>
<pre><code class="language-js">var rawSourceMap = {
  version: 3,
  file: 'min.js',
  names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],
  sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],
  sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',
  mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA'
};

var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);

console.log(smc.sources);
// [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js',
//   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]

console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({
  line: 2,

<h4>With SourceNode (high level API)</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">function compile(ast) {
  switch (ast.type) {
  case 'BinaryExpression':
    return new SourceNode(
      ast.location.line,

  }
}

var ast = parse(&quot;40 + 2&quot;, &quot;add.js&quot;);
console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({
  file: 'add.js'
}));
// { code: '40 + 2',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
</code></pre>
<h4>With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">var map = new SourceMapGenerator({
  file: &quot;source-mapped.js&quot;
});

map.addMapping({
  generated: {
    line: 10,
    column: 35
  },
  source: &quot;foo.js&quot;,
  original: {
    line: 33,
    column: 2
  },
  name: &quot;christopher&quot;
});

console.log(map.toString());
// '{&quot;version&quot;:3,&quot;file&quot;:&quot;source-mapped.js&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;foo.js&quot;],&quot;names&quot;:[&quot;christopher&quot;],&quot;mappings&quot;:&quot;;;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA&quot;}'
</code></pre>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>Get a reference to the module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// NodeJS
var sourceMap = require('source-map');

// Browser builds
var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;

// Inside Firefox
let sourceMap = {};

<h3>SourceMapConsumer</h3>
<p>A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query
for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position
in the generated source.</p>
<h4>new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)</h4>
<p>The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be
<code>JSON.parse</code>'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>version</code>: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sources</code>: An array of URLs to the original source files.</p>

<p><code>names</code>: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual
mappings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceRoot</code>: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourcesContent</code>: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>mappings</code>: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>file</code>: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()</h4>
<p>Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is
inclusive.</p>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)</h4>
<p>Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated
source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The line number in the generated source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>column</code>: The column number in the generated source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bias</code>: Either <code>SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND</code> or
<code>SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND</code>. Specifies whether to return the closest
element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,
respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to
<code>SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and an object is returned with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>source</code>: The original source file, or null if this information is not
available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is
not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>column</code>: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this
information is not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>name</code>: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)</h4>
<p>Returns the generated line and column information for the original source,
line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>source</code>: The filename of the original source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The line number in the original source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>column</code>: The column number in the original source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and an object is returned with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The line number in the generated source, or null.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>column</code>: The column number in the generated source, or null.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)</h4>
<p>Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,
and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings
corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line
that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the
given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column
that has any offsets.</p>
<p>The only argument is an object with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>source</code>: The filename of the original source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The line number in the original source.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The line number in the generated source, or null.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>column</code>: The column number in the generated source, or null.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()</h4>
<p>Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in
the source map, false otherwise.</p>
<p>In other words, if this method returns <code>true</code>, then <code>smc.sourceContentFor(s)</code>
will succeed for every source <code>s</code> in <code>smc.sources</code>.</p>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])</h4>
<p>Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only
argument is the URL of the original source file.</p>
<p>If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is
thrown. Optionally, pass <code>true</code> as the second param to have <code>null</code> returned
instead.</p>
<h4>SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)</h4>
<p>Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a
generated line/column in this source map.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>callback</code>: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the
form <code>{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn, name }</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>context</code>: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of <code>this</code>
every time that <code>callback</code> is called.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>order</code>: Either <code>SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER</code> or
<code>SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER</code>. Specifies whether you want to iterate over
the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the
original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to
<code>SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>SourceMapGenerator</h3>
<p>An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being
built incrementally.</p>
<h4>new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])</h4>
<p>You may pass an object with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>file</code>: The filename of the generated source that this source map is
associated with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceRoot</code>: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>skipValidation</code>: Optional. When <code>true</code>, disables validation of mappings as
they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with
discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when
running tests, if possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)</h4>
<p>Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sourceMapConsumer</code> The SourceMap.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)</h4>
<p>Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated
source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object
should have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>generated</code>: An object with the generated line and column positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>original</code>: An object with the original line and column positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>source</code>: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>name</code>: An optional original token name for this mapping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)</h4>
<p>Set the source content for an original source file.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sourceFile</code> the URL of the original source file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceContent</code> the content of the source file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])</h4>
<p>Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.
Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the
supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings
is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sourceMapConsumer</code>: The SourceMap to be applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceFile</code>: Optional. The filename of the source file.
If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.
Otherwise an error will be thrown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceMapPath</code>: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap
to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.</p>
<p>This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same
directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source
paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten
relative to the SourceMap.</p>
<p>If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,
thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying <code>'.'</code> has the same effect.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()</h4>
<p>Renders the source map being generated to a string.</p>
<h3>SourceNode</h3>
<p>SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating
snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and
column information associated between those snippets and the original source
code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might
use before outputting the generated JS and source map.</p>
<h4>new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>line</code>: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if
it isn't associated with an original line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>column</code>: The original column number associated with this source node, or null
if it isn't associated with an original column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>source</code>: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>chunk</code>: Optional. Is immediately passed to <code>SourceNode.prototype.add</code>, see
below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>name</code>: Optional. The original identifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])</h4>
<p>Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>code</code>: The generated code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceMapConsumer</code> The SourceMap for the generated code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>relativePath</code> The optional path that relative sources in <code>sourceMapConsumer</code>
should be relative to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)</h4>
<p>Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk</code>: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
<code>SourceNode</code>, or an array where each member is one of those things.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)</h4>
<p>Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk</code>: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
<code>SourceNode</code>, or an array where each member is one of those things.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)</h4>
<p>Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the
<code>SourceMap</code> in the <code>sourcesContent</code> field.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sourceFile</code>: The filename of the source file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sourceContent</code>: The content of the source file</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)</h4>
<p>Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking
function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and
the its original associated source's line/column location.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code>: The traversal function.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)</h4>
<p>Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each
source file content and is passed the filename and source content.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code>: The traversal function.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)</h4>
<p>Like <code>Array.prototype.join</code> except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator
between each of this source node's children.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sep</code>: The separator.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)</h4>
<p>Call <code>String.prototype.replace</code> on the very right-most source snippet. Useful
for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pattern</code>: The pattern to replace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>replacement</code>: The thing to replace the pattern with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.toString()</h4>
<p>Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and
concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.</p>
<h4>SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])</h4>
<p>Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a
SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and
original sources.</p>
<p>The arguments are the same as those to <code>new SourceMapGenerator</code>.</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<p>Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run <code>node test/run-tests.js</code>.</p>
<p>To add new tests, create a new file named <code>test/test-&lt;your new test name&gt;.js</code>
and export your test functions with names that start with &quot;test&quot;, for example</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">exports[&quot;test doing the foo bar&quot;] = function (assert, util) {
  ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.</p>
<p>The <code>util</code> argument is the test utility module located at <code>test/source-map/util</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>assert</code> argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have
access to the following assertion functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>doesNotThrow</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>equal</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ok</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>strictEqual</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>throws</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the
tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is
shimmed in that environment. See <code>build/assert-shim.js</code>.)</p>

<p>With this module you can create <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7541">HTTP2</a> / <a href="http://github.com/indutny/bud-backend">SPDY</a> servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).</p>
<p>This module named <code>spdy</code> but it <a href="https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184">provides</a> support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, <code>spdy</code> is compatible with Express.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var spdy = require('spdy'),
    fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  // Private key
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),

  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),

  // **optional** SPDY-specific options
  spdy: {
    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],
    plain: false,

    // **optional**
    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the
    // headers of every request.
    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that
    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': true,

    connection: {
      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size

      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy
      autoSpdy31: false
    }
  }
};

var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

server.listen(3000);
</code></pre>
<p>Client:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var spdy = require('spdy');
var https = require('https');

var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,

  // Optional SPDY options
  spdy: {
    plain: false,
    ssl: true,

    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'
  }
});

https.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
  console.log('yikes');
  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request
  // ...
  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server
  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!
  agent.close();
}).end();
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level
errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe
to the <code>error</code> event and re-emit the captured error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443
}).once('error', function (err) {
  this.emit(err);
});
</code></pre>
<h4>Push streams</h4>
<p>It is possible to initiate <a href="https://httpwg.github.io/specs/rfc7540.html#PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</a> to send content to clients <em>before</em>
the client requests it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {
    status: 200, // optional
    method: 'GET', // optional
    request: {
      accept: '*/*'
    },
    response: {
      'content-type': 'application/javascript'
    }
  });
  stream.on('error', function() {
  });
  stream.end('alert(&quot;hello from push stream!&quot;);');

  res.end('&lt;script src=&quot;/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');
}).listen(3000);
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://httpwg.github.io/specs/rfc7540.html#PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</a> may be sent using the <code>push()</code> method on the current response
object.  The signature of the <code>push()</code> method is:</p>
<p><code>.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)</code></p>
<p>Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.
<code>callback</code> will receive two arguments: <code>err</code> (if any error is happened) and a
<a href="http://openssl.org/">Duplex</a> stream as the second argument.</p>
<p>Client usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });
var req = http.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
});
req.on('push', function(stream) {
  stream.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error
  });
  // Read data from stream
});
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: You're responsible for the <code>stream</code> object once given it in <code>.push()</code>
callback or <code>push</code> event. Hence ignoring <code>error</code> event on it will result in
uncaught exception and crash your program.</p>
<h4>Trailing headers</h4>
<p>Server usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function (req, res) {
  // Send trailing headers to client
  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });

  // On client's trailing headers
  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Client usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {
  // On server's trailing headers
  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
});
req.write('stuff');
req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });
req.end();
</code></pre>
<h4>Options</h4>
<p>All options supported by <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/io.js">tls</a> work with node-spdy.</p>
<p>Additional options may be passed via <code>spdy</code> sub-object:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>plain</code> - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether
to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.</li>
<li><code>ssl</code> - if <code>false</code> and <code>options.plain</code> is <code>true</code>, <code>http.Server</code> will be used
as a <code>base</code> class for created server.</li>
<li><code>maxChunk</code> - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA
chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about
interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.
(defaults to 8192)</li>
<li><code>protocols</code> - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:
<code>['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']</code>)</li>
<li><code>protocol</code> - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,</li>
<li><code>maxStreams</code> - set &quot;<a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">maximum concurrent streams</a>&quot; protocol option</li>
</ul>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>API is compatible with <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // &lt;- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
</code></pre>
<p>Request listener will receive two arguments: <code>request</code> and <code>response</code>. They're
both instances of <code>http</code>'s <code>IncomingMessage</code> and <code>OutgoingMessage</code>. But three
custom properties are added to both of them: <code>isSpdy</code>, <code>spdyVersion</code>. <code>isSpdy</code>
is <code>true</code> when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is
<code>false</code> in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. <code>spdyVersion</code> is either of: <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>,
<code>3.1</code>, or <code>4</code> (for HTTP2).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-js">var Stubborn = require('stubborn');

var options = {
  maxAttempts: 5,
  delay: 1000
};

var stubborn = new Stubborn(task, options, callback);

<h3>pluggable retry algorithm</h3>
<p>All retry algorithms need the current number of attempts as input. As output, they are expected to produce a number that will be used as a factor of the delay.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var Stubborn = require('stubborn');

var options = {

  delay: 1000,
  retryAlgorithm: Stubborn.exponentialBackoff()
};

var stubborn = new Stubborn(task, options, callback);

<h4>implement your own:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">
var options = {
  maxAttempts: 5,
  delay: 1000,
  retryAlgorithm: function(attempts) {
    // delay next execution in options.delay * attempts * 2 
    // thus in attempt #2 we'll have 1000ms * 2 * 2 = 4 seconds delay
    return attempts * 2
  }
};
</code></pre>
<h4>out of the box algorithms:</h4>
<pre><code>var Stubborn = require('stubborn');

var algo1 = Stubborn.exponentialBackoff(2)       // classic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff
var algo2 = Stubborn.simpleExponentialBackoff(2) // same as the above only without the random element
var algo3 = Stubborn.logarithmicProgression(2)   // logarithmic progression
var algo4 = Stubborn.linear(1, 0)                // ax+b
var algo5 = Stubborm.constant(1)                 // constant / fixed progression
</code></pre>
<h4>configure using names instead of functions</h4>

<p>Multi-colour console output from <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk#styles">Chalk</a> with added awesome.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/15102k441h1U1Z1l253J/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%2022.05.15.png" alt="tfunk"></p>
<p>##Install</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install tfunk
</code></pre>
<p>##Usage</p>
<p><strong>Syntax rules:</strong></p>
<p><code>{</code> <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> <code>:</code> <code>YOUR STRING</code> <code>}</code></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p><code>{blue:This is a blue line}</code></p>
<p><strong><code>}</code> is optional</strong></p>
<p><code>{blue:This is a blue line</code> &lt;- Perfectly valid</p>
<p>##Usage</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var tFunk = require(&quot;tfunk&quot;);

console.log( tfunk(&quot;{cyan:tFunk terminal colours&quot;) )

// =&gt; tFunk terminal colours
</code></pre>
<p>Or get a custom compiler with a set prefix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var compiler = require(&quot;tfunk&quot;).Compiler({
    prefix: &quot;[{magenta:tFunk}]&quot;
});

console.log( compiler.compile(&quot;tFunk is awesome&quot;) );
console.log( compiler.compile(&quot;don't you think?&quot;) );

// =&gt; [tFunk] tFunk is awesome
// =&gt; [tFunk] don't you think?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Define your own syntax</strong></p>
<p>You can define your own methods, they receive the string section as the first parameter &amp; have access to the compiler
through <code>this.compile()</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var compiler = require(&quot;tfunk&quot;).Compiler({
    &quot;warn&quot;: function(string) {
        return this.compile(&quot;{red:WARNING:&quot; + string);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use <code>warn</code> anywhere you like.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">console.log( compiler.compile(&quot;{warn: Could not file your config file...&quot;) );

// =&gt; WARNING: Could not file your config file...
</code></pre>
<p>##Examples</p>
<p>Here are some comparisons to chalk, to help you understand how to use tFunk.</p>
<p>###Single Colours</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// chalk
console.log( chalk.red(&quot;This has a single colour&quot;) );

// tFunk
console.log( tFunk(&quot;{red:This has a single colour&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Single Colour mid string</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// chalk
console.log( &quot;This has a single colour &quot; + chalk.cyan(&quot;that begins mid-string&quot;) );

// tFunck
console.log( tFunk(&quot;This has a single colour {cyan:that begins mid-string&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Single Colour with end point</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// chalk
console.log( chalk.red(&quot;This has a single colour with &quot;) + &quot;an endpoint&quot;);

// tFunk
console.log( tFunk(&quot;{red:This has a single colour with }an endpoint&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Two Colours</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// chalk
console.log( chalk.green(&quot;This has &quot;) + chalk.cyan(&quot;two colours&quot;) );

// tFunk
console.log( tFunk(&quot;{green:This has {cyan:two colours&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Nested Colours</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// chalk
console.log( chalk.green(&quot;This has a colour &quot; + chalk.cyan(&quot;nested inside&quot;) + &quot; another colour&quot;) );

//tFunk
console.log( tFunk(&quot;{green:This has a colour {cyan:nested inside} another colour&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Multiple Nested</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// chalk
console.log( chalk.blue(&quot;Multiple &quot; + chalk.cyan(&quot;NESTED&quot;) + &quot; styles in &quot; + chalk.red(&quot;the same string&quot;) + &quot; with an ending&quot;) );

// tFunk
console.log( tFunk(&quot;{blue:Multiple {cyan:NESTED} styles in {red:the same string} with an ending&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Multi line</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var multiline = require(&quot;multiline&quot;);

var string = multiline(function () {/*
{cyan:This is a multi-line coloured string
With a single {yellow:yellow} word in the center of a line
Pretty cool huh?
*/});

console.log( tFunk(string) );
</code></pre>
<p>###Escaping when you need curly braces</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">console.log( tFunk(&quot;This has a \\{\\{mustache\\}\\}&quot;) );
</code></pre>
<p>##TODO</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Colours</li>
<li>[x] Nested Colours</li>
<li>[x] Custom syntax</li>
<li>[x] Prefixed compiler</li>
<li>[x] Make the chain-able API work like this <code>&quot;{white.bgRed: White text, red BG&quot;</code></li>
<li>[x] Offer a way of escaping. Right now, ALL instances of <code>}</code> will be lost

</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">

<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p>Very simple wildcard matching, which is designed to provide the same
functionality that is found in the
<a href="https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/eve">eve</a> eventing library.</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>Work on this project is largely inactive, now so I'd recommend checking out
the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/matcher"><code>matcher</code></a> package
as a solid alternative.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>It works with strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var wildcard = require('wildcard');

console.log(wildcard('foo.*', 'foo.bar'));
// --&gt; true

console.log(wildcard('foo.*', 'foo'));
// --&gt; true

</code></pre>
<p>Arrays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var wildcard = require('wildcard');
var testdata = [
  'a.b.c',
  'a.b',
  'a',
  'a.b.d'
];

console.log(wildcard('a.b.*', testdata));
// --&gt; ['a.b.c', 'a.b', 'a.b.d']

</code></pre>
<p>Objects (matching against keys):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var wildcard = require('wildcard');
var testdata = {
  'a.b.c' : {},
  'a.b'   : {},
  'a'     : {},
  'a.b.d' : {}
};

console.log(wildcard('a.*.c', testdata));
// --&gt; { 'a.b.c': {} }

</code></pre>
<h2>Alternative Implementations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob">https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob</a></p>
<p>Great for full file-based wildcard matching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/matcher">https://github.com/sindresorhus/matcher</a></p>
<p>A well cared for and loved JS wildcard matcher.</p>
