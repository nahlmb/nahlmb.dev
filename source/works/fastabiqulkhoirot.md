Bismillah, Alhamdulillah, Washalatu Wasalam 'Ala Rasulillah.
All praises to Allah, may shalawat always be given to our prophet Muhammad shallallu 'alaihi wasalam.

## #FastabiqulKhoirot
#FastabiqulKhoirot a muslim productivity app.

FastabiqulKhoir bring a concept fresh to-do list application with fresh and clean UI, helping you to manage your day and become productive.

Using this, you can write your to-do list and make a particular journal/project/category of your to-do, simple but proposed to be useful for my own daily needs and also for many people.

the project begins at the beginning time of the coronavirus pandemic in Indonesia, unfortunately the project wasn't finished due lack of preparation for deployment.

build at native android application, using kotlin with MVVM pattern.

while the backend is made using express.js combined with the MongoDB database.

that a really good performance stack of technology.

the project may be stopped but, I really like FastabiqulKhoirot, and yup I still need to be more productive and I'll be like if there is a productivity management app, I hope I can continue FastabiqulKhoirot, or grow the concept and realize a final solution in the form of application that solve productivity problems.
